# Factors Affecting Overstepping the Yellow Strip in the NYC Subway

I did this project along with Pranay Anchan for the course Urban Sensing as part of my Masters in Urban Data Science at New York University.

There are above 150 incidents annually of people being struck by trains in the NYC subway. There is a platform marked yellow near the entry point of the train in every station. This serves as a warning indicator and the authorities say that â€˜standing on or at the yellow platform edge strip is dangerous'. We believe that the primary reason for these incidents is people overstepping onto this yellow platform, which puts them at potential risk of falling over and being struck by the train.

So, we decided to explore the factors involved that make the people do so using video and LIDAR sensors. As the project involved having to collect the data ourselves, we narrowed the scope of the project to just the R-line and the A-C-F line platforms of the Jay Street Metrotech station in downtown Brooklyn.

We suspected 2 major reasons for this overstepping:
1. People step onto the yellow platform due to the platform being overcrowded.
2. People step onto the yellow platform due to space-constrained subway platforms.

So, we chose to capture the video data
